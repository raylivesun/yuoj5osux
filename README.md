## Overview

[Provide a more detailed explanation of the project. What problem does it solve? What is its purpose? How do Dart and Wolfram Language fit together in this project?

For example:
This project, yuoj5osux, aims to [solve X problem] by using Wolfram Language's powerful symbolic and numerical computation capabilities to [perform specific tasks like data analysis, simulations, mathematical modeling, etc.]. The results or functionalities are then exposed or managed through a Dart application, which could be a command-line interface, a web server (using Shelf or Aqueduct/Conduit), or a Flutter application.
]

## Features

-   Feature 1: [e.g., High-performance symbolic computation via Wolfram Engine]
-   Feature 2: [e.g., User-friendly Dart CLI for interacting with Wolfram scripts]
-   Feature 3: [e.g., API endpoints (if Dart serves an API) for accessing computed data]
-   [Add more features as applicable]

## Key Technologies

-   **Dart:** [Specify Dart SDK version, e.g., Dart SDK >=2.19.0 <3.0.0]
    -   [Mention any key Dart packages used, e.g., `http`, `shelf`, `args`]
-   **Wolfram Language:** [Specify Wolfram Engine/Mathematica version, e.g., Wolfram Engine >=13.0]
    -   [Mention any specific Wolfram Language packages/contexts used]
-   [Any other key technologies, e.g., Docker, a specific database, etc.]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

-   **Dart SDK:** Installed and configured. You can find installation instructions [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
    ```bash
    dart --version
    ```
-   **Wolfram Language:**
    -   A licensed version of Mathematica or a free Wolfram Engine for Developers. Installation instructions can be found on the [Wolfram website](https://www.wolfram.com/).
    -   `wolframscript` command-line utility installed and in your system's PATH (usually comes with Mathematica/Wolfram Engine).
    ```bash
    wolframscript -version
    ```
-   [Any other system-level dependencies, e.g., `git`, specific build tools]

*(Adjust the structure above to match your actual project layout)*

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/yuoj5osux.git
    cd yuoj5osux
    ```

2.  **Set up the Dart component:**
    Navigate to the Dart project directory (if it's separate):
    ```bash
    cd dart_app # Or your Dart project's root
    dart pub get
    ```

3.  **Set up the Wolfram Language component:**
    No specific installation steps are usually needed for Wolfram scripts beyond ensuring they are in the project. If your Wolfram code is a package, ensure it's in a location where the Wolfram Kernel can find it (e.g., by adding its parent directory to `$Path` or using project-relative paths).

## Configuration

[Explain any configuration needed. This might include:
-   Environment variables (e.g., `WOLFRAMSCRIPT_PATH`, API keys).
-   Configuration files (e.g., `config.json`, `.env`).

Example:
Create a `.env` file in the `dart_app` directory with the following content:
```env
WOLFRAM_SCRIPT_PATH="../wolfram_scripts/main_script.wls"
# Any other API keys or settings
```
How does the Dart app know where to find `wolframscript` or the Wolfram scripts?
How does the Wolfram script know where to find input data or write output?]

## Usage

### Running the Dart Component

[Explain how to run the Dart part of the project.]

**Example (if it's a CLI):**
```bash
cd dart_app # Or your Dart project's root
dart run bin/main.dart --input data/input/some_data.txt --output data/output/results.json
```

**Example (if it's a server):**
```bash
cd dart_app
dart run bin/server.dart
# Then access via http://localhost:8080 (or your configured port)
```

### Running the Wolfram Language Component

[Explain how to run the Wolfram Language part, especially if it can be run standalone for testing/debugging.]

**Example (using `wolframscript`):**
```bash
cd wolfram_scripts
wolframscript -file main_script.wls -args arg1_value arg2_value
# or
wolframscript -code "Import[\"main_script.wls\"]; MainFunction[1,2,3]"
```

**Example (if it's a notebook `*.nb`):**
Open `wolfram_scripts/my_notebook.nb` in Mathematica and evaluate the cells.

### Interaction Between Dart and Wolfram

[This is a crucial section. Explain how the two parts communicate.]

**Possible interaction methods:**

1.  **Dart calling WolframScript (CLI):**
    The Dart application executes `wolframscript` as a subprocess, passing arguments and capturing its standard output (often JSON or other structured text).
    *Example detail: "The Dart application in `dart_app/bin/main.dart` constructs a command to call `wolfram_scripts/main_script.wls`. Input data might be passed via command-line arguments or by writing to a temporary file whose path is passed as an argument. The Wolfram script processes the input and prints results to standard output, which Dart then parses."*

2.  **File-based exchange:**
    Dart writes input to a file. Wolfram script reads this file, processes it, and writes output to another file, which Dart then reads.
    *Example detail: "The Dart app writes parameters to `data/input/params.json`. It then triggers the Wolfram script. The script `wolfram_scripts/main_script.wls` reads `data/input/params.json`, performs calculations, and writes results to `data/output/results.csv`. Dart then reads this CSV."*

3.  **Using Wolfram Engine API (e.g., via WSTP/MathLink, HTTP, ZeroMQ):**
    More advanced. If you're using such a method, provide details.
    *Example (hypothetical WSTP): "A Dart C interop layer (or a Dart package for WSTP) communicates directly with a running Wolfram Engine kernel."*
    *Example (HTTP): "The Wolfram Language code is exposed via an HTTP API (e.g., using `SocketListen` or `APIFunction` and deployed via Wolfram Web Engine for Small-Scale Deployment or a full Wolfram Application Server). The Dart application makes HTTP requests to this API."*

## Development

### Running Tests

**Dart Tests:**
```bash
cd dart_app # Or your Dart project's root
dart test
```

**Wolfram Language Tests:**
[Explain how to run tests for Wolfram Language code, if any. This might involve `TestReport` objects in notebooks or custom testing scripts.]
Example: "Open `wolfram_scripts/tests/run_tests.nb` and evaluate it, or run `wolframscript -file wolfram_scripts/tests/run_tests.wls`."

### Linting

**Dart:**
```bash
cd dart_app # Or your Dart project's root
dart analyze
```

## Troubleshooting

-   **Problem:** `wolframscript: command not found`
    **Solution:** Ensure Wolfram Engine/Mathematica is installed and `wolframscript` is in your system's PATH.
-   **Problem:** Dart app can't find Wolfram script.
    **Solution:** Check paths in your Dart configuration or code. Ensure relative paths are correct from where the Dart executable is run.
